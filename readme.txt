== Description ==

WooCommerce Indonesian Bank Payment Gateways provides Indonesian banks (BCA and Mandiri for the time being) as payment method (alongside with the store's account name and number) for checkout on WooCommerce. Common Indonesian E-Stores still rely on direct transfer as its payment method hence this plugin is made. This plugin does nothing except:

1. Providing list of Indonesian Banks during checkout
2. Providing Bank information on order notes on the dashboard, customer email, etc

No action performed or cart amount changed upon order. **This plugin assumes that the payment will be handled by direct bank transfer**.

This plugin is released as courtesy of [Hijapedia.com](http://hijapedia.com). I originally made this plugin for [Hijapedia Store](http://store.hijapedia.com) and convinced my employer that there is greater good for everyone by releasing this plugin as Open Source. We hope this plugin will be useful for you.
