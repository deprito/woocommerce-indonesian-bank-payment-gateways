== Description ==

**WooCommerce Indonesian Bank Payment Gateways** is a WooCommerce extension which provides Indonesian banks (BCA and Mandiri for the time being) as payment method for checkout on WooCommerce. Common Indonesian E-Stores still rely on direct transfer as its payment method hence this plugin is made. This plugin does nothing except:

1. Providing list of Indonesian Banks during checkout
2. Providing Bank information on order notes on the dashboard, customer email, etc

No action performed or cart amount changed upon order. **This plugin assumes that the payment will be handled by direct bank transfer**.

This plugin is released as courtesy of [Hijapedia.com](http://hijapedia.com). I originally made this plugin for [Hijapedia Store](http://store.hijapedia.com) and convinced my employer that there is a greater good for everyone by releasing this plugin as an open source plugin.
